The boy drowned, along with his brother and mother, trying to reach Europe from Syria.

Many are coming from Syria, where civil war has killed over 250,000 and displaced 11 million. As debate raged in the media about running the horrific photo, there was no argument about whether Europe and the rest of the West could be doing more to alleviate the horrific suffering. Already David Cameron has announced the U.K. will take in more refugees. But the image was a moral challenge to us all. As a tribute in an Australian paper read: ""Rest in peace Aylan Kurdi.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has written his own document released this week -- The Communist Party's 13th five-year plan -- that might be titled ""The Audacity of the Chinese Dream.""

This blueprint for China's future signals the most momentous shift in direction since the death of Mao and Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up in 1978. Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the ""middle-income trap"" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the ""Thucydides trap"" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

Though this week's air strikes, however warranted, should serve as a sobering rebuke to the kind of thinking that led us into Iraq in the first place, the same voices that headed that ill-conceived charge are still front and center -- like Paul Wolfowitz, who on Tuesday claimed that America had ""won"" the war in Iraq ""in 2009.""
